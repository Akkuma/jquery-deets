This was my favorite and had a lot of potential.\r\n* [Termi's solution](https://github.com/termi/Element.details) lacks animation support and proper IE7 support without loads of extras. \r\nIf this was a completely pure solution without all the other files needed to support IE7 it would be great.\r\n\r\nEverything I wasn't satisfied with I solved.\r\n\r\n# The Deets on Deets\r\n* Supports IE7+, Chrome 12+, FF, Safari (never tested in Opera) and being used in a real product\r\n* Animations that work across all browsers\r\n* Native support without an animation bypasses the polyfill\r\n* Initializes all details elements on load, similar to Manuel Bieh's polyfill, but with the option to manually initialize `.deets()`\r\n* jQuery UI Widget API, `deets('open')`, `deets('close')`, `deets('toggle')`\r\n* Fires `deets.opening`, `deets.opened`, `deets.closing`, `deets.closed` for animated and non-native details\r\n* Uses a single event delegate\r\n* Options can be specified without writing a single line of JavaScript `<details open data-deet='{\"speed\": 0/\"fast\"/\"slow\"}'>` \r\n(currently only supported for auto-initiliazed details)\r\n\r\n## Events\r\n\tdeets.opening\r\nFires immediately before the widget internally maintains that the details has opened\r\n\r\n\tdeets.opened\r\nFires immediately after the animation has completed (if applicable) and after the widget recognizes the details are open \r\n\t\r\n\tdeets.closing\r\nFires immediately before the widget internally maintains that the details has closed\r\n\r\n\tdeets.closed\r\nFires immediately after the animation has completed (if applicable) and after the widget recognizes the details as closed \r\n\r\n## Options\r\n### Speed\r\nTakes either an integer or the string `'slow'`/`'fast'`\r\n#### Examples\r\n`<details open data-deet='{\"speed\": 0}'>`, `<details open data-deet='{\"speed\": \"fast\"}'>`, `<details open data-deet='{\"speed\": \"slow\"}'>`, `.deets({speed: 0/'fast'/'slow'})`\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n* jQuery 1.7.x\r\n* jQuery UI 1.8.x\r\n* **Future:** Alternate version that only requires jQuery 1.7.x","name":"Jquery-deets","tagline":"A details polyfill that actually works well","google":""}
